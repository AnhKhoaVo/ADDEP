# Serum albumin and neurological recovery after spinal cord injury

**Aim**: To investigate if albumin is significantly associated with outcomes after acute spinal cord injury. 

**Data Source**: ADDEP Dataset

Our data cleaning + wrangling process can be found [here](https://github.com/AnhKhoaVo/ADDEP/blob/master/ADDEP_Clean_Analysis.R)

Our analysis is published in [here](https://rpubs.com/AnhKhoaVo/586028)

It is important to note that we are building a **descriptive** model instead of a **predictive** model. Thus, we are more interested in confirming if albumin is a significant prognostic biomarker in this dataset rather than developing a model to predict for future unseen data.
